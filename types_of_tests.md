unit tests
- does a specific method/class/ perform the expected behavior

integration tests
- tests for models
- testing an aspect of the application that allows other features towork

end to end tests
- does the ui behave the way it is expected to


acceptance tests
- does the whole application work and all the aspects the lend to its functioning
- exercise code across many components, carrying out actions that the user completes

there should be more unit tests than integration and more integration tests than acceptance tests
