#TYPES OF TESTS
unit tests
- does a specific method/class/ perform the expected behavior

integration tests
- tests for models
- testing an aspect of the application that allows other features towork

end to end tests
- does the ui behave the way it is expected to


acceptance tests
- does the whole application work and all the aspects the lend to its functioning
- exercise code across many components, carrying out actions that the user completes

there should be more unit tests than integration and more integration tests than acceptance tests

#CHAINGING EXPECTATIONS/BOOLEAN COMPOSITION
expect(buffer).to include("You won").or include("You Lost")
expect(buffer).to include("You won").and include("You Lost")


#WHY YOU SHOULDN'T USE SHOULD
(1 + 1).should == 2 == expect(1 + 1).to eq(2)
- has weird inconsistencies
- requires monkey patching every object
- can generate warnings
- needs workarounds for operator precedence
- should will be moved in to a separate gem
